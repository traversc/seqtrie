Description: A collection of Radix Tree and Trie algorithms for finding similar sequences and calculating sequence distances (Levenshtein and other distance metrics). This work was inspired by a trie implementation in Python: "Fast and Easy Levenshtein distance using a Trie." Hanov (2011) <http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=114>.
