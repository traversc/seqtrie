Version 0.3.6 (2025-12-03)
   * Added `SearchHook` to allow for early stopping during recursive search/alignment (C++ API only)

Version 0.3.5 (2025-10-19)
   * (Performance) Specialized fast `single_gap_search` algorithm, see `RadixTree$single_gap_search`

Version 0.3.3 (2025-10-04)
   * (Performance) Implement Ukkonen style banding to limit DP calculations to near diagonals, improves performance 30-40%

Version 0.3.1 (2025-10-03)
   * (Performance) Reworked trie alignment searches to reuse dynamic-programming workspaces

Version 0.3.0 (2025-09-05)
   * Code cleanup, documentation cleanup, cleaner interface
   * Minor bug fixes

Version 0.2.9 (2025-02-27)
   * Use `STRING_PTR_RO` instead of `STRING_PTR` to align with C API
   * Use `pwalign` instead of `Biostrings` to test alignment (deprecated as of `Biostrings` 2.75.1 on R-devel 3.5)

Version 0.2.8 (2024-05-03)
   * Conditionally run tests if required packages are installed

Version 0.2.7 (2024-01-25)
   * Add Ankerl unordered_dense conditional on C++17 support
   * Add `pwalign` package to suggests field which is responsible for pairwiseAlignment in the biostrings package in BioC 3.19

Version 0.2.6 (2024-01-25)
   * Minor fix for CRAN checks, std::basic_string<uint8_t> deprecated in Clang 18
